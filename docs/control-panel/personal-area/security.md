## 2-Step Verification

With two-step authentication, you need to enter a password and a one-time verification code to enter your account. Two-step authentication is connected separately in the personal settings of the account.

You can connect a way to get a one-time verification code in the Google Authenticator app.

Only the Account Owner can disable 2-Step Verification in the control panel and re-enable it.

If you lose access to the device with the authenticator app, you can contact [tech support](#) to restore access to your account.

1. In the control panel, open the drop-down list in the upper right corner and select **Account Settings**.
