# General information

An instance is a virtual machine that can be created based on computing resources of the OneCloudPlanet cloud platform.

## Computing resources of the cloud platform

- **vCPU** - Virtual processor cores: enumerate resources that are charged for processing data
and operations on virtual machines.

- **vRAM** - Virtual random access memory: a resource that provides for saving that access to data
virtual machines have an hour of work.

- **Boot_HDD** - Boot hard drive: The primary data storage on which it resides
the operating system and other programs that are loaded when the virtual machine is started. 

- **Volume** - The amount of available data storage for the virtual machine specified in the
gigabytes used to store data, programs and other files.

- **Image** - A file containing a ready-to-use virtual machine framework, including the operating system, software, and settings required to creating and running a virtual machine based on this image.

- **Volume backup** - The process of creating a duplicate of data from a volume virtual machine storage for recovery in case of loss or damage primary data.

- **Volume snapshot** - A snapshot of the state of data on a storage volume virtual machine at a point in time that can be used for recovery data or creating new virtual machines.

- **Floating IPs** - static IP addresses that can be assigned or repurposed for non-disruptive virtual machines, providing flexibility and scalability of network access.

## Use Cases

OneCloudPlanet's cloud platform can be used for a wide range of tasks, from simple websites to complex scalable systems.

Hosting internal systems in a private network ensures data and application security. The ability to use resources from different pools and segments of a pool allows for critical systems to be reserved and computational power to be quickly added in response to increasing loads.

Examples of systems that can take advantage of the OneCloudPlanet cloud platform include:

- Simple websites or blogs. With OneCloudPlanet's high level of reliability and configurable system, creating a quality service is possible without significant financial or time costs.

- Complex web applications. OneCloudPlanet's organization of the system structure in the cloud allows for separation of public web servers from applications performing business logic in a closed local subnet. Plus, the ability to allocate additional resources quickly and efficiently enables the creation of effective services with variable loads without overspending on unused capacity.

- Moving or expanding an existing system into a private cloud. OneCloudPlanet's platform offers a secure connection to existing infrastructure and efficient task execution for quick expansion of system capacity or creation of reservation mechanisms.

- Company information technology systems. With OneCloudPlanet's flexibility of settings, implementing unique server configurations is achievable without having to worry about hardware infrastructure.
