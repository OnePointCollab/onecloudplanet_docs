# Deleting a Disk

You can only delete a [local disk](#) together with the server to which it is attached.

[Network disks](#) can be deleted either along with the server or detached from the server and deleted separately.

>:warning If you delete a disk, the data cannot be recovered. We recommend making a backup of your data before deleting a disk â€“ create a disk image or create another disk from the data on this disk. Disk snapshots will be deleted along with the disk.
