- Specify the name of the subnet.

- Enter the IP address, IP version, and subnet gateway.

- In additional settings, you can configure DHCP (optional). By default, DHCP is enabled. Addresses issued by the DHCP server will remain static. Disabling DHCP will cause the IP addresses issued by the DHCP service to no longer be serviced. This can result in virtual machines going offline. If necessary, you can turn it off.

- Specify the DHCP IP address pool.

- Click the **Create** button.
