# Delete a Volume

You can only delete a [local volume](#) together with the server to which it is attached.

[Network volumes](#) can be deleted either along with the server or detached from the server and deleted separately.

>:warning If you delete a volume, the data cannot be recovered. We recommend making a backup of your data before deleting a volume â€“ create a volume image or create another volume from the data on this volume. Volume snapshots will be deleted along with the volume.
