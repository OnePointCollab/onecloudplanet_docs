# Diagnostics Instance

In emergency situations and when there is no network connection to the instance, use the [VNC console](#).

## VNC console

VNC Console is a tool for diagnosing and managing instances that runs in a browser. Use the VNC console if:

- the instance does not have an external IP address or is not connected to the Internet;
- The recommended ways to connect to the instance (via SSH or RDP) do not work.
- setting a root password for an instance on Windows OS.

Access to the VNC console appears immediately after the instance is launched. This allows you to detect failures during the boot of the operating system.

Features of working with the VNC console:

- for text input, you can use only the Latin alphabet;
- the clipboard in the VNC console is not available, you cannot copy and paste text.
