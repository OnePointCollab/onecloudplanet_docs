# Restoring access

If you have problems accessing your account, you can restore access:

- if you are an Account Owner, you can [request password reset](#request-password-reset), or [change email](#change-email-address). Also [turn off 2-Step Verification](./control-panel/personal-area/security#disable-2-step-verification-if-there-is-no-access-to-the-control-panel).

## Request password reset

A user with any role can reset the password.

If you have lost access to the email you used to register, please [change your email address](##).

If you encounter any problems during the registration process, write to the technical support service: [support@ocplanet.cloud](mailto:support@ocplanet.cloud).

1. On the [control panel](https://console.ocplanet.cloud/sign-in) login page, click **Forgot Password?**
